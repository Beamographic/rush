## Status
WIP but playable.

## Map Translation
* Circles above half map height are converted to flying minions, below half are ground minions.
* Circles approximately mid map height are converted to double hits.
* Sliders are converted to note sheets in the same positional fashion as minions.
* Sliders with repeats add minions in the opposite lane of the note sheet at the start, end, and each repeat.
* Spinners are converted to minibosses.

## TODO
* Installation instructions
* Better player sprite
