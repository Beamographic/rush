Custom ruleset for osu!lazer, based loosely on Muse Dash.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdQd65CwkU

## Status
WIP but playable.

## Map Translation
* Circles above half map height are converted to flying minions, below half are ground minions.
* Circles approximately mid map height are converted to double hits.
* Sliders are converted to note sheets in the same positional fashion as minions.
* Sliders with repeats add minions in the opposite lane of the note sheet at the start, end, and each repeat.
* Spinners are converted to minibosses.
* Circles with all of clap, whistle, and finish are converted to a sawblade in the opposite lane.

## TODO
* Installation instructions
* Better player sprite
* Rewinding
* Boss sprite during kiai sections
* Hammers and other minion variants
* Health pickups
* Custom avatars/abilities via mods?
